Task:
1. Evaluate Alignment:
- Assess the alignment of the startup with each fund, ensuring to take into consideration all of the available information.

2. Scoring:
- Assign a score from 0 to 10 for each fund where 0 means no alignment and 10 means perfect alignment.

3. Categorisation:
- Based on the score, classify the match into one of the following categories:
    - Perfect Match: 9–10.
    - Likely Match: 7–8.
    - Potential Match: 5–6.
    - Unlikely Match: 3–4.
    - No Match: 0–2.

4. Rank Alignment Across All Funds:
- Rank funds by DESCENDING alignment score.
- Break ties using alignment strength and data clarity.

5. Justification:
- Provide a brief explanation for the score and category.

6. List warnings:
- List any potential risks or red flags to be noted, such as whether the startup is high-value, or if it is only in a particular location, etc.
- List the warnings in short and succinct phrases, and not sentences.

7. Highlight Gaps:
- Clearly outline any missing information that affects confidence in the assessment.

8. Of Interest to Investor:
- Yes/No
- Provide a brief explanation for the answer

Output:
Format the output format exactly as such:

Format the output in a JSON format as such, and remove any indictators that it is a json file:
